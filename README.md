This is an implementation of the idea proposed in the
["Snowflake as a generic TCP (UDP?) forwarder (like `ssh -L`)"](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40168)
issue.

<!-- ### Example setup with a SOCKS proxy

### Example setup with Tor -->

Thanks to The Tor Project for making [the Snowflake library](gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/) easy to use!
